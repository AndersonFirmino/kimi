# Kimi
A lispy toy programming language that keeps it minimal,
and its interpreter in Python 3.

Created by [Anjana](https://github.com/vakila) at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

## Using Kimi
You have three options for playing with Kimi code:

1. Interact with the Kimi interpreter (REPL):

    $ python3 kimi.py

2. Run a program from a `.kimi` file:

    $ python3 kimi.py my_program.kimi

3. Type a program as a string on the command line (only recommended for simple programs):

    $ python3 kimi.py "(+ 1 2)"

## Basics
* **Parentheses** are used to signal function calls, just like other lispy languages. Parentheses are not used for grouping, or any other purpose. An opening parenthesis must be immediately followed by a function (i.e. a builtin, the name of a `define`d function, or a `lambda` expression). For example, `(+ 1 2)` is a valid Kimi program; `( + 1 2 )`, `(((+ 1 2)))`, and `(+ (1) (2))` are not.
* **Numbers** are limited to integers (e.g. `1`, `-439`). Kimi assumes that anything that *can* be interpreted as an integer *is* an integer; for example, `2` and `+2` become `2`, and `-2` becomes `-2`. A number containing a decimal point (e.g. `2.5`) will *not* be considered an integer, but a **symbol** (see below).
* **Strings** must be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `"my string"`). Kimi assumes anything surrounded by double quotes is a string. Escaped double quotes are not supported, but single quotes can be used (e.g. `"my \"quote\" string"` is not a valid string, but `"my 'quote' string"` is).
* **Booleans** are `true` and `false` (based on Python's `True` and `False`).
* Anything in your program that is not one of the above is considered a **symbol**.

## Defining names
* Names can be assigned like so: `(define x 5)`.
* Any symbol (see above) is a valid name, as long as it does not already exist in the given environment. For example, `x`, `123abc123`, and `--thing--` are valid names, but `define`, `-`, `nil`, and `first` are not, since they already exist as built-in functions (see below).
* Just because something *can* be used as a name doesn't mean it *should*; for example `2.5` and `-2-4` are valid names (see above), but not very good ones!

## Conditionals
* Conditional statements are written in the form `(if <test> <pass_case> <fail_case>)`.
* The first argument (the test) must be an expression that evaluates to a boolean.
* If the test evaluates to `true`, the second argument will be evaluated. If not, the third argument will be evaluated.
* For example: `(if true 1 2) => 1`, `(if false 1 2) => 2`.

## Lambda expressions
* Lambda expressions can be used to create anonymous functions. For example, `(lambda x (* x x))` evaluates to a function that takes one (integer) argument and returns its square.
* Lambdas are written in the form `(lambda args... body)`, where `args...` stands for one or more arguments and `body` stands for an expression that will evaluate to a function application.

## Lists
* `nil` represents an empty list. It is based on Python's `None`, *not* on an empty Python list (`[]`). All non-empty lists are built up from `nil`, i.e. contain `nil` as the last element.
* Non-empty lists are written as `(list 1 2 3)`. Internally, they are represented as nested Python tuples of pairs of values, where the innermost tuple contains `nil` as its second value. For example, Kimi interprets `(list 1 2 3)` as `(1, (2, (3, None)))`.
* `prepend` adds an argument to the front of a list, and `list` is essentially a shorthand for multiple `prepend` calls: `(list 1) = (prepend 1 nil) => (1, None)`, `(list 1 2) = (prepend 1 (prepend 2 nil)) => (1, (2, None))`
* `first` returns the first item in the list: `(first (list 1 2)) => 1`
* `rest` allow you to access the remainder of the list, i.e. the second item of the tuple: `(rest (list 1 2)) => (2, None)`

## Built-in functions
* Arithmetic:
    * `+` (addition): `(+ 1 2) => 3`
    * `-` (subtraction): `(- 2 1) => 1`
    * `*` (multiplication): `(* 2 4) => 8`
    * `/` (floor division, as we have only integers): `(/ 6 2) => 3`, `(/ 7 2) => 3`
    * `%` (modulo): `(% 7 2) => 1`
    * *These functions take only integer arguments*
* Logic:
    * `!` (not): `(! true) => False`, `(! false) => True`
    * `&` (and): `(& true true) => True`, `(& true false) => False`
    * `|` (inclusive or): `(| true false) => True`, `(| false false) => False`
    * *These functions take only boolean arguments*
* Equality:
    * `=`: `(= 1 1) => True`, `(= "yes" "yes") => True`, `(= true false) = False`
    * *This function takes integer, string, or boolean arguments; arguments must be of the same type*
    * Test for inequality using a combination of `!` and `=`, e.g. `(! (= 1 2)) => True`
* Comparison:
    * `>` (greater than): `(> 2 1) => True`
    * `<` (less than): `(< 1 2) = True`
    * `>=` (greater than or equal to): `(>= 2 2) => True`
    * `<=` (less than or equal to): `(<= 3 2) = False`
    * *These functions take only integer arguments*

## Possible future features
* Built-in string functions (e.g. `concat`, `find`, `replace`, `substring`...)
* Macros

## Running tests
Using unittest (recommended):

    $ python3 tests.py

Using doctest (deprecated):

    $ python3 -m doctest -v kimi.py

## Stay tuned!
