# Kimi
A lispy toy programming language that keeps it minimal,
and its interpreter in Python 3.

Created by [Anjana](https://github.com/vakila) at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

## Running programs
Run a program from a `.kimi` file:

    $ python3 kimi.py my_program.kimi

or type a program as a string on the command line (this may give you headaches)

    $ python3 kimi.py "(+ 1 2)"

## Basics
* **Parentheses** are used to signal function calls, just like other lispy languages. Parentheses are not used for grouping, or any other purpose. An opening parenthesis must be immediately followed by the name of a function. For example, `(+ 1 2)` is a valid Kimi program; `( + 1 2 )`, `((+ 1 2))`, and `(+ (1) (2))` are not.
* **Numbers** are limited to integers (e.g. `1`, `-439`). Kimi assumes that anything that *can* be interpreted as an integer *is* an integer; for example, `2` and `+2` become `2`, and `-2` becomes `-2`. A number containing a decimal point (e.g. `2.5`) will *not* be considered an integer, but a **symbol** (see below).
* **Strings** must be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `"my string"`). Kimi assumes anything surrounded by double quotes is a string. Escaped double quotes are not supported, but single quotes can be used (e.g. `"my \"quote\" string"` is not a valid string, but `"my 'quote' string"` is).
* **Booleans** are `true` and `false` (based on Python's `True` and `False`).
* Anything in your program that is not one of the above is considered a **symbol**.

## Names and scope
* Names can be assigned like so: `(define x 5)`.
* Any symbol (see above) is a valid name, as long as it does not already exist. For example, `x`, `123abc123`, and `--thing--` are valid names, but `define`, `-`, and `first` are not, since they already exist as built-in functions (see below).
* Just because something *can* be used as a name doesn't mean it *should*; for example `2.5` and `-2-4` are valid names (see above), but not very good ones!

## Built-in functions
* Arithmetic:
    * `+` (addition): `(+ 1 2) => 3`
    * `-` (subtraction): `(- 2 1) => 1`
    * `*` (multiplication): `(* 2 4) => 8`
    * `/` (floor division, as we have only integers): `(/ 6 2) => 3`, `(/ 7 2) => 3`
    * `%` (modulo): `(% 7 2) => 1`
* Logic:
    * `!` (not): `(! true) => False`, `(! false) => True`
    * `&` (and): `(& true true) => True`, `(& true false) => False`
    * `|` (inclusive or): `(| true false) => True`, `(| false false) => False`

## Planned features
* `lambda`
* Built-in functions
    * Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    * Strings: `concat`, `find`, `replace`, `substring`...?
* Function application
* Variable definition (names)
* Conditionals
* Lists (`empty`, `cons`, `first`, `rest`)

## Running tests
Using unittest (recommended):

    $ python3 tests.py

Using doctest (deprecated):

    $ python3 -m doctest -v kimi.py

## Stay tuned!
